Two configurations(0.0 and 4.0 degree angles of attack) were run for the NACA 2412 
airfoil geometry.


**Grid files:**
Grid files for both configurations are included here. If access to the grid
generation software Pointwise is available, the ".pw" files used to create the 
grids are included here. Additionally, the Plot3D-Format(.x) grids for both
configurations are also included. These may be converted to the ChiDG-Format
HDF5 file using the ``chidg convert`` action.
